Initializing 100 doors...
Making 100 passes through the doors...

============================================
Final State of Doors
============================================

Door 1 is OPEN
Door 4 is OPEN
Door 9 is OPEN
Door 16 is OPEN
Door 25 is OPEN
Door 36 is OPEN
Door 49 is OPEN
Door 64 is OPEN
Door 81 is OPEN
Door 100 is OPEN

--------------------------------------------
Total open doors: 10

Pattern: Only perfect squares are open!
1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100

Verification:
✓ All doors in correct state!

Algorithm explanation:
A door is toggled once for each of its divisors.
Only perfect squares have an odd number of divisors,
so only those doors end up open.
